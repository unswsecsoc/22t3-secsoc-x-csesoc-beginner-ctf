I'm looking for my class on campus and all I've been given is these 3 words

`///draw.enhancement.lifted`

Can you help me find out which building it's in?

**Format:** Replace spaces (if any) with underscores and wrap your answer with `BEGINNER{}`. For example, if this were Red Centre (H13), then the answer would be `BEGINNER{red_centre}`.
