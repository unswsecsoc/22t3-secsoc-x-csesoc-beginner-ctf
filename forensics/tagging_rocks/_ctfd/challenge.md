I took this really nice photo of a bridge over some rocks a few years back, but I've completely forgotten where it was taken :(

I know it was in some sort of geopark, but there are so many! Can you figure out which one it was?

**Format:** Replace spaces (if any) with underscores and wrap your answer with `BEGINNER{}`. For example, if this were Sharp Island Geopark, then the answer would be `BEGINNER{sharp_island_geopark}`.
